# PERIOD Reproduction

This repository records our weekly work on setting up, understanding, and reproducing PERIOD.

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1 – Environment Setup and CVE Reproduction

- Set up the PERIOD development environment and configured the required LLVM/Clang toolchain.
- Built and tested PERIOD's static analysis components.
- Ran initial tests on Double Free and other concurrency-related benchmarks.
- Set up a separate Docker environment using the official PERIOD image to ensure a consistent reproduction environment.
- Reproduced CVE-2016-7911 using PERIOD with a bug depth of 3.
- Identified 8 error interleavings among 19 tested interleavings.
- Replayed all 8 generated schedules and confirmed the SEGV errors using AddressSanitizer.
- Organized the benchmark source code, schedules, logs, and reproduction scripts.

Additionally, a separate reproduction attempt was conducted using WSL2 (preserved in the archive).
